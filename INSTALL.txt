The only non-standard library Curve Ensemble uses is Qt (http://qt-project.org/).

*******************************************************************************************
Microsoft Windows:

Note: The Windows binaries for Curve Ensemble are available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/curve-ensemble/
      Below are the instructions to compile it yourself.

First, you must download and install Qt from http://qt-project.org/downloads
Note: This is a very large library so patience and perseverance are in order.

The basic instructions for installing it are to open up the project Curve Ensemble on
QtCreator (the official Qt IDE) and compile it with that. 
After Qt has been installed, open QtCreator (which comes with Qt) and click File->Open Project and 
browse for the Curve-Ensemble.pro file. To compile the project, you do Build->Build All. 
You can now run Curve Ensemble by clicking the 'Play' button. The actual build files and executable 
will be found in the Qt Project directory which is usually Qt/Projects/. It should be in a folder called
something along the lines of 'Curve-Ensemble build...'. Note: The default project directory can be 
changed in Qt Creator.

Linux

We'll describe how to do this on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and hope for the best with your version of Linux.

1. Using Ubuntu Software Center, install the following packages (this installs Qt4):
   libqt4-dev,  qt4-dev-tools, libqt4-core, libqt4-gui
2. Open a terminal and untar the source tarball with the command
   tar -xzf curve-ensemble-0.90.tar.gz
3. Move into the Curve Ensemble directory with the command
   cd curve-ensemble-0.90
4. and then give the command
   qmake
5. followed by the command
   make
6. This should create an executable file called Curve-Ensemble which can then be run with the command
   ./Curve-Ensemble
7. If you wish Curve-Ensemble to be systemically available, then give the command
   sudo cp Curve-Ensemble /usr/local/bin
